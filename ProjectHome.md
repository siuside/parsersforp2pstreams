LEGAL DISCLAIMER

The streams provided by the parsers are not mine and I have no affiliation with the web sites involved either.I`ve merely created a way for friends and family to access these web sites in a safe and comfortable way.I am not liable for any content that they(the user) would choose to watch with them nor do I condone or support it :P

I`ve chosen to host/maintain these parsers for the above reason and also because I am keen to learn/improve my knowledge of python and this seems a good way..Enjoy :)

SPECIAL THANKS

To Enen92 & j0anita(fightnight) for creating an unbelievable addon and a very detailed wiki..Thanks so much for all your hard work and also xbmchub.com too:)
